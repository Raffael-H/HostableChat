# HostableChat
A small demo project and maybe future open source software

Note: Some of the frontend code is taken from CreativeTim. It was just adjusted for my needs.
Also please be aware that there are some difficulties with the Client.
I haven't figured out yet, why the JARs cannot be executed even though they are executable jars.
A lot of different errors occurr.

Now to the project:

The basic idea was to create a easy to deploy and easy to use Chat that is Open Source.
Check out the code, make your adjustments, build a jar or executable and have fun chatting.

Why? Some people want to be less dependent on the big companies just to have a chat tool.
